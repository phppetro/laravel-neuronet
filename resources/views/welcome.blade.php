            		<p>The main aim of NEURONET INKB is to serve as an overview of projects and activities within the IMI ND programme. The NEURONET INKB provides relevant information about IMI ND projects (such as publications, deliverables, etc). Furthermore, it includes a section with useful reference documents (such as templates, guidelines, etc) and a section with contact details of experts in key project areas (such as sustainability, ethics, data sharing, regulatory/HTA, communication and management).</p>
                <p>There will be different user types with different permissions. Users will be required to create and account and provide some personal information before being able to access the INKB contents.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>How to implement this different user profiles?</h4>
